# Travel-Website
My first website dedicated to those who are interested in visiting Australia. It was done as a project for a course in my second year of bachelor.

1) Install an application that allows to manage a server and databases (e.g. WampServer)

2) Insert username and password (indicated by #) to connect to the databases in the following files: 
    - found.php
    - user_account.php
    - blog.php
    - commentaires.php
    - form.php
    - form_resp.php
    - fini.php
    - sign_in.php

3) Test the website on localhost
